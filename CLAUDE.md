# Agent Instructions

These rules apply to any coding agent used in this repo (Claude, OpenCode, subagents). Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` aligned.

## Mission

Recover Halo CE Xbox behavior faithfully and incrementally.

- **Binary is source of truth:** Evidence-based lifting only.
- **Explicit Unknowns:** Prefer `unknown` or `field_XX` over plausible guesses.
- **Small Changes:** Make small, reviewable commits.
- **Preserve Shape:** Maintain original ABI, layout, side effects, and control-flow.

## Token Discipline

CodeBurn analysis: **~1.7M tokens wasted in 7 days** (~$0.64). The root causes are fixable with strict discipline. These rules are non-negotiable.

### Read-Once Rule
- **Never read the same file twice in one task.** Before reading, ask: "Have I already read this file in this conversation?"
- **The Edit tool confirms success.** Do not re-read to verify your edit worked.
- **Failure exception only:** If an edit fails, re-read *only* the failing line range (≤20 lines), never the full file.

### Research Ratio Gate (4:1 minimum)
- **Target: 4+ reads per edit.** CodeBurn measured 2.2:1 (1,958 reads vs. 878 edits), causing ~932K wasted tokens from edit-without-research retries.
- Before editing any function, perform at least these research steps:
  1. `rtk rg '<function_name>' src/` — find all callers and related symbols.
  2. `rtk read <file> -o <start> -l <limit>` — read the exact target lines only.
  3. `rtk jq '<filter>' kb.json` — verify signatures and ABI.
  4. `rtk git diff -- src/ kb.json` — check current uncommitted state.
- If you have not done 4 reads, do more research before editing.

### File-Specific Bans & Caps
| File / Directory | Action | Max Lines | Why |
|------------------|--------|-----------|-----|
| `kb.json` | `rtk jq` ONLY | **0** | 6,000+ lines; 239 redundant reads = ~143K tokens |
| `objects.c`, `units.c`, `sound_manager.c` | `rtk read -o -l` | **100** | 100+ redundant reads each = ~300K tokens |
| `build/`, `build_debug/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `halo-patched/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/` | **NEVER** | **0** | Generated artifacts; 7 reads = ~4K tokens for zero value |
| Any `*.log` | **NEVER** | **0** | Run the command instead of reading output |

### Session Memory
Maintain a mental ledger of files already read in this conversation. If you need a fact from a file you've already read, recall it from context or `rtk rg` for the specific string — do not re-read the file.

## Workflow

### 1. Research & Analysis
- **Scope-first:** Start tasks with exact path(s), symbol(s), and line range(s).
- **Token Discipline:** See the [Token Discipline](#token-discipline) section above. Use line-ranged reads (`rtk read -o <start> -l <limit>`). Never re-read a file after a successful edit.
- **Large files:** For files >300 lines, always read with `rtk read -o <start> -l <limit>`. Cap at 100 lines per read. See the File-Specific Bans & Caps table.
- **kb.json:** `rtk jq` ONLY — never use the Read tool. See the File-Specific Bans & Caps table.
- **JSON Mastery:** ALWAYS use `rtk jq` for querying/parsing `kb.json`. Never use `python -c`.
- **Pre-edit research:** Before editing any function, run `rtk rg '<function_name>' src/` to find all callers and related symbols.
- **Ghidra Pre-flight:** Before using any `ghidra` or `ghidra-live` MCP tool, run `python3 tools/audit/check_ghidra_mcp.py`. If it fails, alert the user and stop.
- **Tooling:** Always prefix with `rtk`. Use `rtk fd` (files), `rtk rg` (text), `rtk ast-grep` (structure), `rtk fzf` (selecting).

### 2. Implementation & kb.json Discipline
- **No Speculation:** Do not invent behavior or names without binary evidence.
- **ABI Stability:** `@<reg>` annotations in `kb.json` are **immutable**. Never remove or change register assignments.
- **New Symbols:** Register-arg callees must be added to `kb.json` with `@<reg>` and called by name.
- **No Inline ASM:** The build system handles thunks via `kb.json`. Do not use inline assembly in C.
- **Separation:** Keep logic changes separate from cleanup/formatting.
- **Never transcribe MSVC intrinsics as C function calls.** Ghidra shows them as regular calls but they have non-standard ABIs that corrupt the stack or registers when called from C. Use the equivalent C idiom — the compiler generates the intrinsic automatically:

  | Address | Intrinsic | Refs | Ghidra shows | Write in C instead |
  |---------|-----------|------|--------------|-------------------|
  | 0x1d90e0 | `_chkstk` | 71 | `regparm(1)` call | declare locals normally (or `static` for large buffers) |
  | 0x1d9068 | `_ftol2` | 228 | `_ftol2(var)` or cast | `(int)float_expr` |
  | 0x1dd5c8 | `__SEH_prolog` | 74 | mangled params | `__try/__except` (or skip SEH functions) |
  | 0x1dd601 | `__SEH_epilog` | 73 | mangled return | (paired with prolog) |
  | 0x1dd620 | `_allmul` | 10 | 4-arg call | `(int64_t)a * b` |
  | 0x1dd660 | `_aullshr` | 1 | register call | `(uint64_t)val >> shift` |
  | 0x1dd680 | `_aullrem` | 1 | 4-arg call | `(uint64_t)a % b` |
  | 0x1dd770 | `_aulldiv` | 1 | 4-arg call | `(uint64_t)a / b` |

  Never add these to kb.json. They are compiler runtime, not game functions.

- **Verify callee buffer sizes.** Ghidra may under-size local buffers. When a lifted function passes a stack buffer to a callee, check the callee's `memset`/init size in disassembly — it reveals the true required size. Example: `FUN_0013fc20` (object placement init) writes 0x88 bytes; Ghidra showed the caller's buffer as 0x30, causing a stack overflow.

- **MSVC stack layout overlap hazard.** When a lifted function calls an **unlifted** function by pointer (vtable, callback, function table), the callee may read from offsets within a local array that MSVC placed overlapping with other local variables. Our clang build uses a different stack layout, so those offsets contain garbage instead of the expected data. **Detection:** decompile the unlifted callee and check every offset it reads from the array parameter. Cross-reference with the original function's `[EBP±N]` disassembly to see if those offsets land on other locals. **Fix:** explicitly copy the required data into the array at the expected offsets before the call. Example: `FUN_0009fd30` passes `marker_buf` to creation physics (vtable `0x26ab10`). The callee reads position from `marker_buf+0x60`, which in the original MSVC layout overlaps with `local_position`. Fix was to copy `local_position` into `marker_buf+0x60` explicitly.

- **Verify every call site against disassembly.** The decompiler is a draft. Three known pitfalls:
  1. **Register aliasing:** Ghidra loses track of EBX/ESI/EDI in long functions and substitutes the wrong variable. Trace each PUSH backward from the CALL instruction.
  2. **Push-then-fstp:** MSVC passes floats via `PUSH <dummy>; FSTP [ESP]`. Ghidra reports the dummy (often a pointer) as the argument instead of the FPU-computed float.
  3. **Struct field rotation:** MSVC reorders stores for scheduling. Ghidra reassembles them in instruction order, producing wrong struct offsets. Derive offsets from `MOV [EBP±N]` in disassembly, not the decompiler.
  4. **Cross-product operand swap:** `cross(A, B)` and `cross(B, A)` look nearly identical in the decompiler — the FLD/FMUL order before FSUBP differs but the components look the same. Always verify the subtraction order against disassembly: `cross(A,B)[0] = A[1]*B[2] - A[2]*B[1]`. Getting it backwards negates the vector, which can cause invisible geometry, flipped UV mapping, or reflected projections.

### 3. Build & Verification
- **Golden Master Test Harness:** A specialized test harness intercepts the engine boot in `src/halo/shell_xbox.c`. It lets you run functions inside the engine context and verify their side-effects/return values against the exact Xbox ASM output. 
  - *Usage:* Add tests to `src/halo/test_harness.c`. Ensure your function is unmapped in `kb.json` (`"ported": false`), run `rtk python3 tools/verify/run_golden_tests.py` to capture the original FPU hex values. Then map your function (`"ported": true`) and press Enter to verify your C implementation.
  - *Use cases:* FPU math functions, struct/object initializers, and complex isolated state transitions.
- **RTK Build:** Use `rtk python3 tools/build/build.py -q --target halo` (warnings/errors only).
- **XDK Verify:** After lifting FPU-heavy functions (geometry, math, projections), run `rtk python3 tools/verify/xdk_verify.py src/path/to/file.c` to compile with the original MSVC 7.1 compiler and compare against the delinked reference. Review any `[FPU-WARN]` output — it flags potential operand-order bugs. Requires a delinked reference in `delinked/` (export via `ghidra-live` MCP).
- **Validation:** Run the narrowest meaningful validation first.
- **XBDM Priority:** Prefer real Xbox XBDM verification over xemu when available.
- **Failure Policy:** If an edit fails, re-read only affected ranges before retrying.

### 4. Commit Discipline
- **Use `/lift` for all new function ports.** Do not manually implement and commit lift work without going through the `/lift` skill. It runs ABI audit, build, and verification stages that catch real bugs (calling convention mismatches, register-arg errors). Bypassing it has caused page faults and silent regressions.
- **No Freeform Messages:** Never write freeform lift commit messages.
- **Standard Command:** After staging changes, run:
  ```bash
  rtk python3 tools/audit/generate_lift_commit.py --batch-name "<short description>" > /tmp/commit_msg.txt
  rtk git commit -F /tmp/commit_msg.txt
  ```
- **ABI audit gate:** `generate_lift_commit.py` runs `audit_reg_abi.py` on all newly ported functions. If any fail, no commit message is generated. Use `--skip-abi-audit` only for emergencies.
- **Pre-commit hook:** The git pre-commit hook runs both the baseline guard and lift ABI audit on staged changes. `--no-verify` is the emergency bypass.

## Repo Guardrails
- **Noisy Dirs:** Never read or search inside `build/`, `build_debug/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `halo-patched/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/` unless explicitly asked. These are generated artifacts. 7 reads = ~4K tokens for zero value. See the File-Specific Bans & Caps table.
- **No Log Files:** Never read `build.log`, `build_output.log`, or any `.log` file. Run the build or command instead.
- **Scoped Diffs:** When checking changes, scope git diffs to source: `rtk git diff -- src/ kb.json CMakeLists.txt`. Bare `git diff` includes tracked build artifacts.
- **RTK Always:** Prefix ALL shell commands with `rtk` (e.g., `rtk git status`, `rtk pytest`).
- **Output Schema:** For non-trivial work, report: Target, Confirmed, Inferred, Uncertain, Proposed Code, kb.json updates.

## Analysis Tools
- **`tools/analysis/frontier.py`** — Decompilation frontier scoring and target recommendations.
- **`tools/analysis/classify_common.py`** — Analyze `<common>` functions for reclassification into proper objects. Uses delinker exports and XBE `__FILE__` strings as evidence. Run with `--delinker-analyze` for full binary-evidence analysis (requires Ghidra), or `--summary` for a quick static overview.
- **`tools/audit/batch_delink.py`** — Batch-export delinked reference objects for all kb.json objects.
- **`tools/analysis/maintain.py`** — Source file organization and function placement checks.
- **`tools/verify/xdk_verify.py`** — Compile a source file with the original XDK MSVC 7.1 compiler (`RXDK/xbox/bin/vc71/CL.Exe`) and compare against the delinked reference. Flags FPU operand-order differences that indicate cross-product swaps, subtraction direction errors, etc. Use `--fpu-only` for focused output.
- **`tools/verify/compare_obj.py`** — LCS-based instruction comparison between two COFF objects. Used by `xdk_verify.py`.
