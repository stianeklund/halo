/*
 * FUN_00060c40 -- valid_real_point2d: returns true when both components of a
 * real_point2d (x, y) are finite (neither NaN nor +/-Inf).
 *
 * A float is non-finite iff its IEEE-754 exponent field is all ones, i.e.
 * (bits & 0x7f800000) == 0x7f800000. The original materializes the boolean
 * in full EAX (MOV EAX,1 / XOR EAX,EAX); Ghidra collapsed the two returns to
 * void because callers discarded the result. Same 0x7f800000 mask idiom as
 * valid_real_rgb_color.
 *
 * ABI: cdecl, one stack pointer arg (real_point2d*), pure integer leaf.
 *
 * Shape (delinked 00060c40.obj): each component is copied into a float local
 * first, then bit-tested through the local — VC71 spills the local into the
 * dead param home slot ([EBP+8], MOV [EBP+8],ECX / MOV [EBP+8],EAX), keeping
 * the frame at zero locals. Testing point[N]'s bits directly loses those
 * stores (59.5%); the local recovers them. The tests are spelled as a nested
 * valid-chain (`!= mask` guarding inward, shared `return 0` tail) so both
 * branches compile to JE into the trailing XOR EAX block — goto/early-return
 * spellings made VC71 flip the second branch (85.7%). 100.0% VC71.
